# nbody-simulation
Simulates gravitational interaction between multiple celestial bodies in 2D using Newtonian physics.
Modular structure ("nbody.py","visualise.py")
## Features
- Uses  Runge-Kutta integration methods through phython coding
- Visualizes orbits and energy conservation
- Animate trajectories with `matplotlib.animation`

## Tech
- Python, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Run in Jupyter Notebook or from CLI

## Demo

Current example: Moon orbiting our planet

Uses the newtons formmula for force of gravity on an N-body physical system and then graphs it accordingly.

Motion is integrated using "RK4" which balances accuracy with performance and simulation speed.
